  <p>Show Time is a simple time planning tool for radio shows. Show items and their durations are added to a show and the total show length is displayed.</p>

  <p>This is a <a href="http://100daysofcode.com/">100 Days of Code</a> project.</p>

  <h2>Status</h2>

  <p><em>Show Time</em> is minimally usable. Shows and their elements can be added and removed and it keeps a running total of time.</p>

  <h2>Entering Time Lengths</h2>

  <p>This information will added to the show page, but isn't there yet.</p>

  <p>Valid formats for entering time are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 2 3</li>
    <li>1:2:3</li>
    <li>1h 2m 3s</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Known Issues</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Drag and drop sorting is not working in Firefox</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>

  <p>ShowTime uses a web-browser feature named local storage to store your information. In many ways it makes your web-browser act like a desktop program.</p>

  <strong>Please be aware of the following before using:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>If you clear local storage in your web-browser you will delete your ShowTime information</li>
    <li>Each web-browser has its own local storage. This means if you run ShowTime in Chrome, you will not see your information in FireFox, Edge, or Safari.</li>
    <li>If you run ShowTime in an anonymous browser session, no data is saved when the browser window is closed.</li>
  </ul>
