  <p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Drag and drop sorting is not working in Fire Fox</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>

  <p>ShowTime uses a web-browser feature named local storage to store your information. In many ways it makes your web-browser act like a desktop program.</p>

  <strong>Please be aware of the following before using:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>If you clear local storage in your web-browser you will delete your ShowTime information</li>
    <li>Each web-browser has its own local storage. This means if you run ShowTime in Chrome, you will not see your information in FireFox, Edge, or Safari.</li>
    <li>If you run ShowTime in an anonymous browser session, no data is saved when the browser window is closed.</li>
  </ul>
