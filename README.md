# Show Time

*Show Time* is a simple time planning tool for radio shows. 
Show elements and their durations are added to a show and the total show length is displayed.
Elements can be edited and their order changed using "drag & drop".
To provide a demo the browser's local storage is used.
Please see the <strong><em>Data Storage</em></strong> section (below) for details.
The show can be saved as a text file.

This is a [100 Days of Code](http://100daysofcode.com/) project.

## Status 

There are known issues in Firefox and IE11. There are no known issues in Chrome.

A number of new features are planned and will be added as time permits.

## Known Issues

* Drag and drop sorting is not working in Fire Fox

## Data Storage

ShowTime uses a web-browser feature named local storage to store your information. In many ways it makes your web-browser act like a desktop program.

**Please be aware of the following before using:**

* If you clear local storage in your web-browser you will delete your ShowTime information
* Each web-browser has its own local storage. This means if you run ShowTime in Chrome, you will not see your information in FireFox, Edge, or Safari.
* If you run ShowTime in an anonymous browser session, no data is saved when the browser window is closed.
