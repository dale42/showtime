# Show Time

*Show Time* is a simple time planning tool for radio shows. Show items and their durations are added to a show and the total show length is displayed.

This is a [100 Days of Code](http://100daysofcode.com/) project.

## Status 

*Show Time* is currently not usuable in any practical way.

Show Time can add and remove shows and show elements. Total show time and element editing is not implemented, yet.</p>

**Known Issues**

* Drag and drop sorting is not working in Fire Fox

##Data Storage

ShowTime uses a web-browser feature named local storage to store your information. In many ways it makes your web-browser act like a desktop program.

**Please be aware of the following before using:**

* If you clear local storage in your web-browser you will delete your ShowTime information
* Each web-browser has its own local storage. This means if you run ShowTime in Chrome, you will not see your information in FireFox, Edge, or Safari.
* If you run ShowTime in an anonymous browser session, no data is saved when the browser window is closed.
